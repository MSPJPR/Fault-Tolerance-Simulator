Features

1. Fault Simulation

Simulates transient and permanent faults.

Displays fault-handling recommendations based on the type of error.



2. Fault Metrics Calculation

Calculates and displays availability using MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures).

Provides a user-friendly interface for input and output.



3. Interactive UI

Intuitive design with drop-downs, input fields, and real-time feedback.

Styled using CSS for responsiveness and accessibility.



4. Cross-Platform Compatibility

Lightweight and works seamlessly on mobile devices via browsers or Termux setup.
